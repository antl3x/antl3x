# Speed Tiers: Freemium with the Currency of Time

A few days ago, I came across an intriguing article titled [_**"Frugly vs. Freemium"**_](https://taylor.town/frugly) on [**Taylor's blog**](https://taylor.town), which I highly recommend for its insightful content. The article introduced the concept of users **paying to remove "ugliness"** from their digital experiences. 

This sparked an interesting thought: **what about time?** In today's fast-paced world, waiting is often seen as an inconvenience. Whether it's an increased ETA for an Uber ride or a slow-loading webpage, **every additional second of waiting feels burdensome.**

This realization led me to explore a new dimension in the evolution of freemium models, focusing on **time as a commodity**. Traditionally, freemium models offer basic services for free while reserving premium features for paying customers. However, I propose a novel twist to this model, emphasizing the **value of time**. 

In the digital era, time is arguably our most precious asset. Consider a text-to-speech tool, for example. Under the standard model, users might find themselves in a queue, leading to slow processing times. However, by opting for a premium service, they can **bypass the queue** and access the service more quickly.

This approach goes beyond the conventional strategy of avoiding advertisements. It's about **delivering what users need in a more timely manner**. Reflect on the frustration of enduring a 30-second ad. The irritation stems not just from the disruption but from the **irrevocable loss of time**.

Reimagining the freemium model to treat time as the valuable currency it is offers users a clear choice:

- **Endure the wait** without cost
- **Pay to optimize** their time usage

This "**Speed Tier**" system is straightforward and acknowledges our inherent desire to **manage our time efficiently**.
