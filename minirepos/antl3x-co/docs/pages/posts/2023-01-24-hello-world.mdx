# Hello World!

Welcome to my inaugural blog post! For the longest time, my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault has been brimming with personal notes, insights, and reflections, collected over years of learning and experiences. These musings, often scribbled in moments of inspiration, have remained solely in my possession, unseen by the world outside.

Today, that changes.

I've realized that these thoughts and discoveries could potentially benefit others, just as they have enriched my understanding. So, I've decided to take a leap and start this blog. My goal is to transform my private collection of knowledge into a public treasure trove, where ideas can be shared, discussed, and built upon.

Whether you're a curious learner, a fellow enthusiast in software engineering / data / ai / financial markets, or simply here by chance, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and knowledge sharing. Let's delve into these notes together, uncovering insights and sparking conversations along the way.

Thank you for being here, and I can't wait to share my world with you.
